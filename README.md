Rigorous coupled-wave analysis based on paper ["Three-dimensional (vector) rigorous coupled-wave analysis of anisotropic grating diffraction", JOSA A, 7(8), 1990]

Features:

- Anisotropic layer
- Conical incident
- Slanted grating
- Customized base modes (e.g., left/right circularly polarized light)
- Multiple Cascaded layers

TODO:

- Document
- Improvement using S-matrix
- Anisotropic input and output regions
- Superposed gratings
